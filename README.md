An app for finding recipies and adding your own. The other features are bookmarking recipies and adjusting the number of servings (with recalculating the amount of ingredients)

One of the projects from "The Complete JavaScript Course" by Jonas Schmedtmann.
Development period: September/October 2022

This project helped me understand the REST API, and async JS in general, even deeper. I also had my first experience with the MVC architecture.

I plan on rebuilding the project with React and Typescript.
